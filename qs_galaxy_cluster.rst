Galaxy elastic cluster (SLURM)
==============================

The Galaxy elastic cluster section allow user to deploy Galaxy and a SLURM cluster with automatic elasticity.

This enables dynamic cluster resources scaling, deploying and powering on new working nodes depending on the workload of the cluster and powering-off them when no longer needed. This provides an efficient use of the resources, making them available only when really needed.

.. Warning::

   VCPUS and Memory values selected by user have to match Image Flavor presets, otherwise a different flavor, as close as possible to the one selected, will be automatically assigned.
   Please read carefully the section: :doc:`qs_virtual_hdw_presets`.

#. Copy & Past your SSH key, to login in the Galaxy instance:
