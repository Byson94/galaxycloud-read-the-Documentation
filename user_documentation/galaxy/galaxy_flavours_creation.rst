Create and test Galaxy flavours
===============================

New flavours can be easily added to Laniakea through a Pull Request on our `GitHub page <https://github.com/Laniakea-elixir-it/Galaxy-flavours>`_.

In this step will be described how to make a Pull Request to the Laniakea GitHub repository to create a new flaovur.

#. Fork the Laniakea GitHub `Galaxy flavours repository <https://github.com/Laniakea-elixir-it/Galaxy-flavours.git>`_.

#. Clone the forked repository:

   ::

     git clone https://github.com/<user-name>/Galaxy-flavours.git

#. Create a new directory with the name of your flavor. For example, ``galaxy-testing`` in this case.

   ::

     mkdir galaxy-testing

#. To create a new Galaxy flavour, a tool list file, written in YAML syntax, has to be provided. The ``examples`` directory provides some samples.

   Move in the flavour directory:

   ::

     cd galaxy-testing

   Edit your tool list file with your favourite text editor adding  the following default configuration lines:

   ::

     ---
     
     api_key: admin
     galaxy_instance: http://localhost:8080
     install_resolver_dependencies: true
     install_tool_dependencies: false

   Then, add your tool list. For each tool to install, ``name``, ``owner`` and ``tool_panel_section_label``, which labels the tools section in the right Galaxy panel, have to be provided:
   ::

     tools:

       - name: fastqc
         owner: devteam
         tool_panel_section_label: "tools"
       
       - name: bowtie2
         owner: devteam
         tool_panel_section_label: "tools"
       
       - name: bowtie_wrappers
         owner: devteam
         tool_panel_section_label: "tools"
       
       - name: sam_to_bam
         owner: devteam
         tool_panel_section_label: "tools"
       
       - name: bam_to_sam
         owner: devteam
         tool_panel_section_label: "tools"

   In this case the

#. If you don't need to add one or more workflows to your flavor, move to the next step.

   Create a new directory in your flavour directory:

   ::

     mkdir workflow


   For example, in our galaxy-testing flavour we, currently, have:

   ::

     ~/Galaxy-flavours/galaxy-testing$ ls

     tool-list.yaml  workflow
 
   Navigate in this directory and copy here your Galaxy workflows with ``.ga``Â extension.

#. We are now ready to create a Pull Request. Add your files to your GitHub repository. For example, for our testing flavour:

   ::

     cd galaxy-testing 

     $ git add tool-list.yaml workflow/Galaxy-Workflow-test.ga

     $ git commit -m "add galaxy-testing flavour"
     [master 2bc262d] add galaxy-testing flavour

#. Finally, from GitHub it is possible to create a Pull Request to the Laniakea repository:

We will review and test your flavour and enable it on Laniakea. 

These changes must be merged to the main branch of the `Galaxy flavours repository <https://github.com/Laniakea-elixir-it/Galaxy-flavours.git>`_. The merge will b

Conda support
-------------

Conda is a package manager like apt-get, yum, pip, brew or guix and it is, currently, used as default dependency resolver in Galaxy.
